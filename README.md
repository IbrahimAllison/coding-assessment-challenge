# coding-assessment-challenge

**Description**
This is a quiz and a game as well. The objective of the challenge is to mirror the technial interview or the coding assessment that is used for testing a developer's coding knowledge, skills, and abilities.

**Motivation for the Project**
I am motivated to see how assessment questions are coded. I am already thinking about creating a Computer Based Test for an elementary school after completing this project.

**What Problem Does it solve?** 
It provides a solution on how to create a coding quiz for a technical coding interview scenario. It aims at simulating the coding interview experience.

**Usage**
The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. 

The user continues to respond to the on screen questions. When all the questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over and no more questions are displayed on the screen.
